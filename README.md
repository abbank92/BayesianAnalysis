# Bayesian Final Project

This repository holds a Bayesian analysis exploring hate crimes in the US. The poster contains a nice presentation of the results and a write-up on the process and model selection.

Please see the `hate-crimes` folder for the data used in the analysis and the code generating the MCMC results and the plots used in the poster.
